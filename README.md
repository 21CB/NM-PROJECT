# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, etc. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of houses.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from house_price_prediction. It contains information about houses including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and the corresponding selling price.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/21CB/house-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd house-price-prediction
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open and run the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.

## Project Structure
- `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Results
The trained model achieves [insert performance metric] accuracy on the test dataset. 

## Future Work
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Exploring additional features for better predictions.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
